I am indebted to the members of my doctoral committee for their suggestions and insights, and especially grateful to Dr. Artem Durnev, Dr. Jon Garfinkel, and Dr. Qihang Lin for their help and encouragement. This research was supported in part by data provided by Nasdaq, Inc. as well as by computational resources provided by The University of Iowa. Finally, I wish to thank my parents for their love, support, and patience.
